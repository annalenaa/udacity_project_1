# Stackoverflow Survey 2018 
## Analyzing developers in the U.S. and India

## The Project

The aim of this project is to provide a simple descriptive analysis of the Stackoverflow Survey 2018 regarding developers in the U.S. and India. The questions/features of interest for this short analysis were:
* Job satisfaction
* What do you hope to be doing in 5 years?
* Time since last job change

The project provides a visual for each of these questions as well as a couple others. The results were published [here](https://medium.com/@klassannalena/being-a-developer-in-the-united-states-vs-being-a-developer-in-india-5bb1d4e55c).

-----------------------------------------

## How to get started

The analysis was conducted using the following libraries:

* pandas (0.23.4)
* numpy (1.15.4)
* matplotlib
* zipfile

## The data

## Key findings of the analysis

* There is an overall lower job satisfaction among Indian developers, compared to U.S. developers. The reasons for this could be many, however, the type of tasks and responsibilities someone has at work seem to play a role in them. Only few Indian developers want to be doing the same thing in 5 years.
* The proportion of developers wanting to start their own company is higher among Indian developers than U.S. developers. Since the U.S. to me are the country of entrepreneurship and innovation, this came as a surprise. This makes me curious about what we can expect from Indian developers in the future!
* More U.S. developers than Indian developers are in their job for at least 2 years. This is probably a hint at the overall higher job satisfaction, unless people have their reasons to stay in their job although they are unhappy.
